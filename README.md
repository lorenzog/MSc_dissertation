This repository contains my dissertation for the degree of Master of Science in Evolutionary and Adaptive Systems and the respective source code (Sussex University, 2008).

The code evolves strategies to explore an "environment" using a minimalistic device (basically a binary sensor). The idea is to show how minimal strategies can be evolved reasonably simpler, and how they could be combined together to explore more complex environments through multi-dimensional sensory inputs.

The dissertation describes also experiments done IRL with the Enactive Torch (https://enactivetorch.wordpress.com/) which is a binary device that vibrates when an obstacle appears in front of its sensor at a certain distance. Think of it as a "cane-less" cane for visually impaired people.

The code requires the FANN and SFMT libraries. 

Instructions are at the end of the dissertation PDF.
